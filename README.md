# PowerShell Scripts
PowerShell hacks I've created to solve some problem or another.

## TrendUninstall
A script I wrote to help me remove the Trend Micro OfficeScan XG client from Win7(coming soon)/Win10 Desktops.

## Universal PowerShell 5.1 Upgrade Tool
Used to check if PowerShell 5.1 is installed on a host computer and if not, install it along with any necessary prerequisites.
